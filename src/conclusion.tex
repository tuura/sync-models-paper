\section{Conclusion}

We describe a set of transformations and property encodings to verify
asynchronous circuits using formal tools for synchronous logic. The
transformation gives designers the option to use conventional synchronous
tools, an important consideration for industrial users, and enables them to
verify mixed sync-async systems using a unified verification flow, set of
tools and formalisms. We demonstrate the method practically by verifying a
use-case multi-clock system consisting of three synchronous CPUs, a shared bus
and an asynchronous arbiter. Even though dedicated asynchronous tools are much
faster at verifying asynchronous circuits that have high degrees of
concurrency, the method remains a feasible and attractive solution for many
realistic mixed sync-async systems in which the asynchronous parts are
relatively small.
