Asynchronous circuits are pervasive in modern synchronous systems, but they
are still designed and verified in isolation, using dedicated asynchronous
design flows, formalisms and tools. We describe a method to verify gate-level
asynchronous circuit implementations using formal verification tools and
property languages for synchronous logic. We report observations and findings
from applying this method to use case designs using an industrial and an open
source formal verification tools for synchronous logic, and compare
performance and verification capabilities against two verification tools for
asynchronous circuits. Finally, we discuss the advantages and practical
considerations of bridging synchronous logic verification tools to the domain
of asynchronous circuits. Our main conclusion is that, while there are
performance penalties, there is still significant value in enabling users to
verify asynchronous circuits using tools that may be more familiar, trusted or
more widely adopted.
